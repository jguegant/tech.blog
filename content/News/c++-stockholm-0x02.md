I had the chance to participate last week in a **C++ meetup**.
This [Stockholm meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/) is fairly recent but has a lot of potential!
I am always enjoying my time during these sessions, surrounded by the smart and passionated people.
In the unlikely chance that you are living around **Stockholm**, or decided to visit the capital of Scandinavia (and start missing your keyboard), I would highly recommend you to join this group.

For the second edition of our conference **C++ Stockholm 0x02**, I volunteered for talk about a subject I already adressed in the blog: [SFINAE and compile-time introspection]({filename}../C++/sfinae-introduction.md).
Overall, it was a good exercise for a first talk but I definitely need more training :). 
I discovered that it is much harder than I expected to explain code in live.
Thanks to the meetup team, I have a video of this talk with a very nice editing job done on it. 
It is always a weird experience to watch yourself on a video and was not so keen to put it here in the first place. 
But since this video has already *leaked* among my friends (or foes in that case) and colleagues, I guess I might place it for the posterity!
So, here it is:

You can find a pdf version of the slides right [here]({filename}../images/SFINAE-compile-time-introspection.pdf).
