New year, new conference! 
This time, my employer [King](https://discover.king.com/about/) helped me to organize a first pilgrimage to [CppCon](https://cppcon.org/) for me and another colleague.
You can fathom how enthusiastic I was to finally making it there!
Although I might be a bit late on the "trip-report-race", I think that it is still worth to relate my overall experience of the event and then move onto a list of recommended talks you should watch-out on Youtube. 

# About CppCon (2018):

## The event:


**CppCon** is the most renowned conference for all the C++ afficionados. So far held anually in the cozy city center of Bellevue, Washington (or less precisely somewhere close-by to Seattle for those like me that are not into north-american geography), **CppCon** let you explore the **C++** world with various talks, keynotes and other activities provided by some accomplished members of the community. The event is usually happening at the end of September and lasts 5 days, or even more for those attending the training sessions. The program is really plentiful and you would need to watch presentations from 8.00am to 10.00pm, have an ubiquity capacity to be simultaneously in 6 rooms at the same time, and have infinite memory to be able to absorbe all the C++ knowledge flowing during these days.

Do not get me wrong, while the conference is impressive when it comes to the amount of content, that do not imply that this content is out of the reach of the commoners. On one hand you have hairy topics like "Compile-time programming" being discussed, and on the other hand you have acces to gentle introductions to some features of the language. Dedicated or novice C++ users will appreciate as much the conference but for different reasons. A novice will bring back home a lot of new keywords/concepts to plunge into. Someone who follow C++ news, may not make as many discoveries at **CppCon** than at [CppNow](http://cppnow.org/), but she/he will gain a lot of inspiration/motivation from other C++ fellows and will be exposed to other point of views on the language.

Does this sound exciting to you, but you missed the opportunity to come this year? No worries, **CppCon** has one of the best [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos) where they upload all the talks. I have always been impressed by the quality of their videos and the frequency at which they can produce such material. Now, I can say that behind the scene (or actually in front...), they have an excellent video-shooting crew in each of the conference rooms. On a side note, all keynotes were introduced by a pretty good live rock-band, which you can see at the beggining of the videos. The CppCon organizers really put a lot of efforts in the entire event!

# My experience over there:

Right before leaving Stockholm, I had the great idea to listen to my favorite C++ podcast [CppCast](http://cppcast.com/). The guest for that week was **Bryce Adelstein Lelbach** who is one of the organiser of CppCon. Bryce had 4 advices for any new attendee of the conference, which matched my experience at [Meeting C++]({filename}../C++/trip-report-meetingcpp.md) last year and turn out to be valid for CppCon too:

- Have no regrets! Indeed, as an attendee you will quickly discover that two or three appealing talks will be on the same time slot. Just randomly pick one of the talk or none if you need to rest a bit. If luck is not on your side that day and you missed a terrific talk due to that issue, you will naturally hear about it from others and you will have plenty of time to binge-watch it on Youtube later on. Having that in mind, I was much more relax at this conference than I was at my very intense days at **Meeting C++**. If you really dislike to choose you will anyway ends-up following someone, you just chit-chated within the corridors, to the talk of his choice. Which brings us to the second advice you should follow...
- Engage with the community!
- Be confused!
- Be bold! The concentration of "legendary C++ devs" per square meter is even higher than in **Meeting C++**.

Following these rules made a very smooth to me.

Having seen

Generally, I was not disapointed by the quality of the slides and the speakers. I picked up quite a few new concepts, prepared myself for the future of **C++** (C++20) and refreshed myself on some fields I did not touch for a while.

Lightning talks are too late!

# The chief's suggestions of the year:

Once again, here is a menu of most of the talks I particulary enjoyed. The legend is pretty simple:

- ðŸ’€ : The difficulty of the talk (ðŸ’€: Begginer friendly, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: Intermediate, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: High exposure to C++'s dark corners)
- â˜… : My interest for the talk (â˜…: Good talk, â˜…â˜…: Tasty talk, â˜…â˜…â˜…: Legendary talk)

I promise you not to spoil all the talks, but simply try to give an overview of what you can expect within them. Although most of the talks are most likely worth to be seen, I forced my-very-subjective-self to pick very few of them. I have seen people with very different "favorite talk" and you should not feel sad if your own talk is not part of this not-so-prestigious list.
