New year, new conference! 
This time, my employer [King](https://discover.king.com/about/) helped me to organize a first pilgrimage to [CppCon](https://cppcon.org/) for me and another colleague.
You can fathom how enthusiastic I was to finally making it there!
Although I might be a bit late on the "trip-report-race", I think that it is still worth to relate my overall experience of the event and then move onto a list of recommended talks you should watch-out on Youtube. 

# About CppCon (2018):

## The event:


**CppCon** is the most renowned conference for all the C++ afficionados. So far held anually in the cozy city center of Bellevue, Washington (or less precisely somewhere close-by to Seattle for those like me that are not into north-american geography), **CppCon** let you explore the **C++** world with various talks, keynotes and other activities provided by some accomplished members of the community. The event is usually happening at the end of September and lasts 5 days, or even more for those attending the training sessions. The program is really plentiful and you would need to watch presentations from 8.00am to 10.00pm, have an ubiquity capacity to be simultaneously in 6 rooms at the same time, and have infinite memory to be able to absorbe all the C++ knowledge flowing during these days.

Do not get me wrong, while the conference is impressive when it comes to the amount of content, that do not imply that this content is out of the reach of the commoners. On one hand you have hairy topics like "Compile-time programming" being discussed, and on the other hand you have acces to gentle introductions to some features of the language. Dedicated or novice C++ users will appreciate as much the conference but for different reasons. A novice will bring back home a lot of new keywords/concepts to plunge into. Someone who follow C++ news, may not make as many discoveries at **CppCon** than at [CppNow](http://cppnow.org/), but she/he will gain a lot of inspiration/motivation from other C++ fellows and will be exposed to other point of views on the language.

Does this sound exciting to you, but you missed the opportunity to come this year? No worries, **CppCon** has one of the best [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos) where they upload all the talks. I have always been impressed by the quality of their videos and the frequency at which they can produce such material. Now, I can say that behind the scene (or actually in front...), they have an excellent video-shooting crew in each of the conference rooms. On a side note, all keynotes were introduced by a live rock-band, which you can see at the beggining of the videos. Whether you appreciated the music or not, it is hard to deny that CppCon organizers really put a lot of efforts in the entire event! 

# My experience over there:

Right before leaving Stockholm, I had the great idea to listen to my favorite C++ podcast [CppCast](http://cppcast.com/). The guest for that week was **Bryce Adelstein Lelbach** who is one of the organiser of CppCon. Bryce had four advices for any new attendee of the conference, which matched my experience at [Meeting C++]({filename}../C++/trip-report-meetingcpp.md) last year and turn out to be valid for CppCon too:

- Have no regrets! Indeed, as an attendee you will quickly discover that two or three appealing talks will be on the same time slot. Just randomly pick one of the talk or none if you need to rest a bit. If luck is not on your side that day and you missed a terrific talk, you will naturally hear about it from others and you will have plenty of time to binge-watch it on Youtube later on. Having that in mind, I was much more relax at this conference than I was at my very intense days at **Meeting C++**. If you really dislike to choose you will anyway ends-up following someone, you just chit-chated with within the corridors, to the talk of his choice. Which brings us to the second advice you should follow...
- Engage with the community! If you are planning to go to CppCon to appreciate a better version of the talks than on YouTube, you are doing it wrong! By going over there, you actually loose the possibility to watch the talk at your own pace... What you gain instead, as an attendee, is the opportunity to mingle with people with very different backgrounds, exchange tips and tricks and feel part of community bigger than the few C++ colleagues you are working with. Programmers seldom have the reputation of being extroverts, but you will always find someone that can introduce to his connections and slowly build relationships. I met quite a few people from **SwedenCpp** over there and it was really fun to see them in another context!
- Be confused! You should not be afraid to be out of your confort zone when it comes to the content of the talks. You may be mortified at the idea that a guru will suddenly drop a very complicated C++ concept on stage, and you will be there lonely, not knowing what on earth he/she/it is talking about. Truth is, very few people (if not none) can claim knowing everything about such a vaste language that is C++. Usually during a "productive" C++ conference, you will dress-up a list of keywords / ideas that you will explore later-on. This year, I promised myself to look further on the edge-cases of Class Template Argument Deduction (CTAD), prepare myself for C++20's **contracts** and play with clang's tooling internals.
- Be bold! The concentration of "legendary C++ devs" per square meter is even higher than in **Meeting C++**. While I did not shoot any selfie (not that I wanted to either) with any of these legends, I discussed briefly with few of them, and you can too! People at **CppCon** are here to celebrate their favorite language, not to act as elitists, which make everyone very approachable. One of the talk I attended was on a [proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0052r8.pdf) (Woes of Scope Guards and Unique Resource - 5+ years in the making - By Peter Sommerland) I implemented at work. During the talk, Peter mentioned a relatively serious bug introduced in one of the revision. Right after that talk, I had the unique chance to have a face-to-face discussion with him. It turns out, my implementation did not suffer from that bug, but was instead hiding another one. I was so glad that I could access to that person so easily! 

Following these precepts, I experienced a very wonderful week made of C++ and human interactions, and I would highly recommend **CppCon** to anyone having a slight interest in the language.

I still have one and only one complain about the event: the time slot for the lightning talks.
For those that are not aware, the lightning talks are short presentations of roughly 5min, easier to submit, often light-minded but also damn interesting.
Due to the short format, people often go straight to the point which is really pleasant to watch.
For instance, this year there was an epic lightning talk battle on [East Const vs West Const](https://arne-mertz.de/2018/05/trailing-return-types-east-const-and-code-style-consistency/) or a touching "Thank You" speech from **Dr. Walter E. Brown**. 
If that sounds interesting to you, you will have to stay awake from 8.30pm to 10.00pm which is where my grudge comes from.
After absorbing some C++ since roughly 9.00am, and with a pretty strong jetlag (=~9h for central Europeans) you really need to channel all your inner motivation to attend any of these late activities.
The lightning being such joyfull part of **CppCon**, I would argue that some of them could be moved to an earlier slot in the day...

Enough of my pseudo-rant on an almost perfect event and let's continue with some more concrete reporting! 

# The chief's suggestions of the year:

Once again, here is a menu of most of the talks I particulary enjoyed. The legend follow the same rules:

- ðŸ’€ : The difficulty of the talk (ðŸ’€: Begginer friendly, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: Intermediate, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: High exposure to C++'s dark corners)
- â˜… : My interest for the talk (â˜…: Good talk, â˜…â˜…: Tasty talk, â˜…â˜…â˜…: Legendary talk)

I promise you not to spoil everything in the talks, but simply try to give an overview of what you can expect within them or some conclusions. Although most of the talks are most likely worth to be seen, I forced my-very-subjective-self to pick very few of them. I have seen people with very different "favorite talk" and you should not feel sad if your own talk is not part of this not-so-prestigious list.

### [Keynote] Concepts: The Future of Generic Programming (the future is here) - Bjarne Stroustrup - ðŸ’€â˜…â˜…â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018/blob/master/Keynotes/concepts_the_future_of_generic_programming/concepts_the_future_of_generic_programming__bjarne_stroustrup__cppcon_2018.pdf)
- Video: [link](https://youtu.be/HddFGPTAmtU)

The Bjarne himself, creator of C++ (for those really out of the loop), kick-started the conference with a keynote on a long-overdue C++ feature: [Concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)).
Indeed, as early as 2003, Bjarne and some members of the committee have been pushing for Concepts as an extension to C++ templates to simplify the life of us poor template consumers.
Sadly, a first version, dimmed too complicated, of the feature was rejected for **C++11**. Nine years later, Bjarne and his crew is back with a version "Concepts Lite" that will be integrated into **C++20**.  

Let's face it, C++ templates have always been a pain to use due to the absence of constraints on the template parameter types.
Take a look at this very simple piece of code:
```c++
template <class T>
void foo(T&& t) {
    t.print();
}

template <class T>
void bar(T&& t) {
	foo(t);
}

struct A {};

int main() {
    A a;
    bar(a);
}
```
Your never-satisfied compiler will refuse to compile it with the following error message:
```
<source>: In instantiation of 'void foo(T&&) [with T = A&]':
<source>:10:8:   required from 'void bar(T&&) [with T = A&]'
<source>:17:10:   required from here
<source>:5:7: error: 'struct A' has no member named 'print'
     t.print();
     ~~^~~~~
```
This is an horrifying warning message as we often see nowadays.
Your compiler do warn you about the absence of a **print** method in **A** far down in **foo**!
In this specific case, we only have two layers in the call stack which is very reasonable. 
But most often when using functions provided by the Standard Library, your type will violate some constraints reaaallly deep down.
As a newcommer you will often struggle with your compiler vomiting a bizarre message of 100 lines when using templates, which is not the best first experience (to say the least). 
Moreover, by looking at the signature of **bar**, nothing tells you that the template parameter **T** needs to have a **print** member function. That's frustrating!

With concepts you can define in elegant way the constraints that your parameters must respect. Have a look at we could do with Concepts in this case:
```c++
template <class T> concept bool IsPrintable = requires (T a) { // Define a reusable concept "IsPrintable".
    a.print(); // Any template parameter of T respecting "IsPrintable" must have a print function. 
};

template <IsPrintable T> // Explicitely tells that T must respect the concept.
void foo(T&& t) {
    t.print();
}

template <IsPrintable T> // Same here!
void bar(T&& t) {
    foo(t);
}
```
Which would give us the following much more accurate error message:
```
<source>:19:10: error: cannot call function 'void bar(T&&) [with T = A&]'
     bar(a);
          ^
<source>:11:6: note:   constraints not satisfied
 void bar(T&& t) {
      ^~~
<source>:1:33: note: within 'template<class T> concept const bool IsPrintable<T> [with T = A&]'
 template <class T> concept bool IsPrintable = requires (T a) {
                                 ^~~~~~~~~~~
<source>:1:33: note:     with 'A& a'
<source>:1:33: note: the required expression 'a.print()' would be ill-formed
``` 
Some sceptical gurus will tell you that this can be emulated with some witch-crafted [SFINAEs]({filename}../C++/sfinae-introduction.md). 
Concepts were not christmas wish-list for **C++**, but I have to admit that Bjarne's talk hipped me a lot! 

### [Talk] How to Write Well-Behaved Value Wrappers - Simon Brand - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ â˜…â˜…:

- Slides: [coming soon]()
- Video: [coming soon]()

Good speakers are like good wine, you are seldom disappointed.
Having attended Simon's talk on debugger internals last year and enjoyed it a lot, I took the chance to hear what he had to say on value wrappers.
You may not know what is a value wrapper, but I surely bet that you already manipulated some provided by the Standard Library: [std::pair](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair), [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple), [std::optional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional)... 

It might be a breeze to work with most of these wrappers (certainely not you verbose [std::variant](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant)), but the poor souls writting implementations of these must go to great lengths to make them behave as they should. Value wrappers, as their name imply, try to mimic as closely as possible the type of a given value. All the types have some basic properties: can it be explicitely constructed? Are the [special member functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_functions) noexcept? Can it be called in a constant expression? Can it be compared? And much more... A wrapper must react exactly in the same way when it comes to these properties. 

In this talk, Simon compares the old fashioned way to tackle these issues and present how it will look like as soon as the concepts and bunch of other proposals arrive in C++20:

- Explicit operator akin to the noexcept operator
- [P0748R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0848r0.html) to use **concepts-based require clauses** on these member functions to enable or disable them. A.K.A goodbye a lot of uncessarry conditional inheritance. 
- [P0847R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0847r0.html) which permits to deduce correctly the implicit **this** parameter type of a member function. A.K.A goodbye all the methods overloading on const, volatile and ref qualifiers. 
- [P0515R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0515r2.pdf) that unify all the comparison operators into one. A.K.A goodbye all the operator overloads.
- ... Some more that I surely forgot.

Regardless if you are planning to write such wrappers or not, I would suggest to watch the talk to refresh yourself on some tricky C++ mechanisms.

### [Talk] Fancy Pointers for Fun and Profit - Bob Steagall - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ â˜…â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018/blob/master/Presentations/fancy_pointers_for_fun_and_profit/fancy_pointers_for_fun_and_profit__bob_steagall__cppcon_2018.pdf)
- Video: [coming soon]()

**Bob Steagall** promoted his own talk on **fancy pointers** in an early September **CppCast** episode.
So here I was, ready to learn more about these mystical beasts!

**Allocators** in C++ are rather infamous for their over-engineered interface, which is not useful 99.42% of the time. This even forced the committee to come-up, in **C++17**, with a lighter interface called [PMR](https://youtu.be/v3dz-AKOVL8). But this time, the good old full-blown interface found a very clever usage in Bob's hands. Indeed, [std::allocator_traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator_traits) has a nice type property **pointer**. Which means that the Standard offers a nice [customization point](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/03/19/customization-points-for-functions/) to switch normal pointers **T\*** for a given allocator to a type that acts like a pointer would. These wanna-be pointers are what you call **fancy pointers**. Somehow, you can think of **fancy pointers** as more generalized concept of [smart pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer).   

Now let's say that you would like to serialise to / deserialise from binary a container-like object (vector, list...) with a bunch of [trivial objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt767760.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) inside and send it through a network. Providing that you are targeting one and only one architecture, which is often the case for servers, you may be able to use [std::memcpy](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/memcpy) to transfer the representation of this container into a **char\*** buffer. Then, the whole buffer can be wired to another machine. At the endpoint, to deserialise the container from that buffer you can re-use **std::memcpy** to copy back the binary representation into a container ([note that you cannot rely reinterpret_cast in C++ for that purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/5fk3wn/undefined_behavior_with_reinterpret_cast/)...). This will work smoothly as long as none of the stored PODs have pointers as members referencing each others! Indeed, pointers are usually not valid as soon as you cross the boundary of a process or a machine. This huge drawback can be avoided by introducing **fancy pointers** to your code-base. 

For instance, Bob brings **offset_ptr** to the table, which permits to express some reference between two elements using their distance from each others:
```
struct obj
{
	value_type v;
	offset_ptr<value_type> p; // optional
}; 

Example of the layout of a container of objs:

                               -2
                +-----------------------------+
                |        1                    |
                |     +-----+                 |
 +--------------v-----------v--------------------------------+
 |  v  |  p  |  v  |  p  |  v  |  p  |  V  |  p  |  v  |  p  |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
          |                             ^
          |                             |
          +-----------------------------+
                       3

```
With a bit of boilerplate, this **offset_ptr** can be handled by a custom allocator that can be injected into a container, making different address mappings a non-issue.
I find this solution pretty elegant and is a good showcase on how extensible the Standard Library is. 


### [Talk] RVO is Harder than it Looks: the story of -Wreturn-std-move - Arthur O'Dwyer - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018/blob/master/Presentations/return_value_optimization_harder_than_it_looks/return_value_optimization_harder_than_it_looks__arthur_odwyer__cppcon_2018.pdf)
- Video: [coming soon]()

It is commonly admitted that returning by value seldom has a performance impact in C++. Two mechanisms [(N)RVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision#Return_value_optimization) and [move semantics](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_02.html) will most likely kick in to avoid unecessary copies:

```c++

struct A
{
// ... some members
};

A foo() {
	A a;
	// ...
	return a;
}

A a = foo(); // The return value is directly constructed in a's stack location (RVO), can fall back onto the move-constructor otherwise. 
```

As time goes by, the C++ standard has stronger and stronger guarantees that copy ellision (RVO) will happen in these situations.
At the same time, forcefully moving the return value can a pretty huge pessimisation and is taught as an anti-pattern:
```c++
A foo() {
	A a;
	// ...
	return std::move(a); // Will hinder the compiler to choose RVO instead of move constructor.
}
```
In the worst case scenario, if the object has no move-constructor, the compiler might resort to use the copy constructor, which could have been avoided with RVO.


Now in the **C++ land** nothing really holds true if you look closer at some corner cases. And "no-move-on-return-values" rule mentioned right above can be debated for that reason. Arthur was valiant enough to inquire into this topic and found few cases where a call to **std::move** will BE an optimization. Notably, if you return a value with a type convertible to the function's return type thanks to an [explicit conversion operator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator), you should apply **std::move**. Arthur introduced a new warning in clang [-Wreturn-std-move](https://reviews.llvm.org/D43322) to avoid this pitfall. I will gadly turn that warning on as soon as I can.

I liked the talk for delving into such precise topics ; although, Arthur rushed on quite a few slides and even skipped a whole bunch of them, meaning that there was more to say on this theme. 

### [Talk] State Machines Battlefield - Naive vs STL vs Boost - Kris Jusiak - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018/blob/master/Presentations/state_machines_battlefield_naive_vs_stl_vs_boost/state_machines_battlefield_naive_vs_stl_vs_boost__kris_jusiak__cppcon_2018.pdf)
- Video: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZVby-PuXM0)

**Kris Jusiak** is the proud author of two library aspiring to be into [Boost](https://www.boost.org/): [Boost.DI](http://boost-experimental.github.io/di/) and [Boost.SML](https://github.com/boost-experimental/sml). This talk was partly based on the later one. More precisely **Kris** compared how different implementations of a state machine would fare in term of performance and ease to maintain.

**Kris** started with a good ol' implementation designed around a giant switch case roughly similar to this code:
```c++
class connection {
	// ...
	void update(event e) {
		switch(state_) {
			case connecting:
				if (e && e->type == event_type::established) {
					state_ = state::connected;	
					log("connected");	
				}
			break;
			case connected:
				// ...
				do_connected_things();
				// ...
			break;
			// ...
			default:
				throw runtime_exception("bad state");
			break;
		}
	}
	// ...

	int variable_for_connected_state;
	int another_variable_for_connected_state;
	int variable_for_disconnected_state;
	// ...
	state state_;
};
```
Surely, this implementation will perform rather decently, but at the cost of being extremely hard to maintain if the amount of states increase. Sadly, a lot of code-bases for games or networking have plenty of these ugly state machines sprinkled around. **C++** is all about **zero-cost abstractions**, which means that if you want to avoid some serious posttraumatic stress disorders after working on such projects, you may want to look at other choices than switch.

Therefore, **Kris** jumped onto an implementation using [std::variant](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant) which reminded me a lot a blog post from [Kalle Huttunen](https://khuttun.github.io/2017/02/04/implementing-state-machines-with-std-variant.html). **std::variant** will permit you to isolate the variables necessary for your different states and will enforce a stricter handling of your state with [std::visit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit). It is not. After dwelling with two oldish and slow Boost libraries, Kris turned onto  

He then moved onto [](https://khuttun.github.io/2017/02/04/implementing-state-machines-with-std-variant.html).

More than **Boost.DI**
