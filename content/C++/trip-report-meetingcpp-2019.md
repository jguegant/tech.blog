Time to go back to the roots!
Me and quite a few colleagues have been travelling across the old continent to attend the renowned [Meeting C++](https://meetingcpp.com/) conference in Berlin.  
Fully backed by our employer, [King](https://discover.king.com/about/), we were able to enjoy a yearly dose of C++ talks at an excellent venue.
I was thrilled at the idea of retrying the "German C++ experience" and my expectation were once again met! 
**C++20** being right at the corner, I also had in mind to prioritise talks concerning this topic as much as possible.

As the tradition goes, I will relate a bit my experience of the event and dress-up a list of the talks I would highly suggest to search for!

# A tour of Meeting (2019):

I did a decent [introduction of the event two years ago]({filename}../C++/trip-report-meetingcpp.md) and most of it stand true.
So rather than doing another summary, I will compare and contrast my experience at **Meeting C++** with the one I had last year at **Cppcon**. 


## The venue:

When it comes to the facilities of the venue, I found the rooms in the Andels Hotel to have unequal quality.
While the two big rooms on the lower floors are excellent, the upper floor ones are really long and narrow. 
If the nature made you of a short stature or you don't have the best eyesight (or both like me), you will have a hard time following some of the slides.
I cannot remember having any issue with that at **CppCon**. Having a rooms with inclined rows helps a lot!

Probably to avoid having crammed rooms and irritating noises, **Meeting C++** also has this concept of closing doors of the tracks as soon as the talk starts and not letting annoying enter. I am not quite convinced by this idea, it extremely frustrating to not be able to move to another talk if the current one is not to your taste. 

## The German cuisine:

Being French, a detail often comes to my mind... the food provided during the event!
Unlike **CppCon**, this event offers catering all day long, and tasty one mind you. 
Obviously you cannot expect conference meals to deserve a [Michelin stars's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin), but there was plenty and with a lot of variety. Is that a must-do for a conference? Probably not, but it is both really convenient and it also brings a LOT of interactions between members of the community. People will tend to have more casual conversations if dinning in the same place rather than going out. From what I can recall, **CppCon** provided snacks here and there, but nothing worth remembering.

## The talks:

Last but not least, the speakers! On one hand, **Meeting C++** has more diversity: the speakers are coming from all around Europe and you may discover a lot of new names and some hidden gems that didn't/wouldn't make it to **CppCon** - not everyone is willing or can afford to travel to the US and A. On the other hand, the quality of **CppCon** talks felt a bit higher. I believe that this is partly due to having more fluent English and C++ speakers available in the new continent.

I have had a first hand, albeit short, experience on what it takes to be a speaker at such an event.
I gave a lightning talk highly inspired on the [performing try emplace post]({filename}../C++/trip-report-meetingcpp.md) I did at the beginning of this year.
While it went rather smoothly (if not for a small technical issue with my slides), I felt intimidated when I went on stage in front of maybe 300 people (best-guess estimation).

You can find a pdf version of the slides right [here]({filename}../images/associative-containers-the-art-of-inserting-gracefully.pdf) and maybe a YouTube record of that talk will pop at one point on the [Meeting C++ channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MeetingCPP).
It was interesting to see that the **lightning talks** were a lot more formal than at **CppCon** where jokes and bad-puns are a constant.
I believe that the lightning talks format was changed recently at **Meeting C++**: it used to be its own dedicated track on a full afternoon, whereas now it became a more casual evening event. We, the lightning speakers, were also informed a bit late on where, when and how should the talks happen.

That said, doing a presentation on a innovative topic, interesting and understandable by all requires a lot of upfront work.
Having to do it in a foreign language, for one hour, in front of a rather massive crowd is even more demanding.
I am still amazed by what all these speakers gave us during these three days! 

# The chief's suggestions of the year:

Here comes again the menu of the talks I particularly enjoyed. The legend follow the usual rules:

- ðŸ’€ : The difficulty of the talk (ðŸ’€: Beginner friendly, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: Intermediate, ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€: High exposure to C++'s dark corners)
- â˜… : My interest for the talk (â˜…: Good talk, â˜…â˜…: Tasty talk, â˜…â˜…â˜…: Legendary talk)

 No need to say that I will not spoil everything in the talks, but I will simply try to give an idea of what the talk was about. If the talk seems to be of your taste, I highly encourage you to watch the video record of it or the slides. 
 If your talk or a talk that you liked very much is not part of this menu, do not feel too disenchanted about it.
 I had to curate this list to a few talks or I would have to write an entire novel.
 Feel free to post your opinion about the talks in the comment section.

### [Keynote] Design Rationale for <chrono> - Howard Hinnant - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€â˜…â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://meetingcpp.com/mcpp/slides/2019/Hinnant.pdf)
- Video: [coming soon]()

The Howard Hinnant, himself, came to present his new-born baby: the support of date and calendars in the [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono](chrono header). Howard Hinnant the dude behind the r-values and move semantics.

Will be available in C++20.

### [Talk] 10 techniques to understand existing code - Jonathan Boccara - ðŸ’€â˜…â˜…â˜…:

- Slides: [link](https://meetingcpp.com/mcpp/slides/2019/understand_code.pdf)
- Video: [link]()


### [Talk] Modules - The Beginner's Guide - Daniela Engert - ðŸ’€ðŸ’€â˜…:

### [Talk] Compile Time Regular Expressions with Deterministic Finite Automaton - Hana DusÃ­kovÃ¡ - ï¿½ðŸ’€â˜…:

### [Talk] C++20 The small things - Timur Doumler - :
### [Talk] C++20 Coroutines - Milosz Warzecha - :

### [Talk] The Dawn of a New Error - Phil Nash - :

### [Talk] Testing Legacy Code - Fuzzing for Better Input Data - Tina Ulbrich, Niel Waldren - :

### [Other]:

Sadly, I would need to (std::)allocate myself a lot of more time to be able to cover all the goodies you can get from this **CppCon**.
I have watched many different talks and had great echoes from some others. Here is what I would consider worth to google for:

- Using C++20's Three-way Comparison <=> - Jonathan MÃ¼ller
- Oh No! More Modern CMake - Deniz Bahadir
- And many more...

# Conclusion:
I am wondering how much of the knowledge I acquired will hell true once the standard is out. And more importantly, how much knowledge will I be able to apply when it gets trough.
