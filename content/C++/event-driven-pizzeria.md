### My favorite pizzeria is asynchronous and event-driven... my C++ server too:
Computer programming is a science, or even an art, and as such its community follows trends for better or worse. Today, I am highly positive in our future so let's speak about the new holy grail of any back-end developer, the panacea for web servers: an **asynchronous** **event-driven** architecture. Forget about your old synchronous habits, now we enter in the era of **non-blocking I/O** models, **coroutines**, **callbacks**, hacky **generators**, and all-mighty **asynchronous calls**. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is conquering the market partly due to its full embrace of such an architecture. Google's latest child, the [Go](https://golang.org/) Programming Language, was designed around this concept. Why would we not do the same?

I could directly dive into some funky tricks to implement **stackless coroutines** in **C++14**, or explain **epoll** in details. Yet the very basic internals of such technologies are pretty mysterious for some of us, when it actually has a very straightforward explanation. Why is it more efficient than old-fashioned technologies? There must be a thread somewhere? Where is the loop then?

This post will focus on these fundamentals questions, and it will a base for some coming topics. I would not dare to simply throw you **spaghetti code**, so let's first explain these concepts using **pizzas**.
